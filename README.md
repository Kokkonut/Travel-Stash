# Travel-Stash

## Description

This project was created to make planning for travel a quick and easy task, being able to have an all-in-one application where you can have a personalised log-in saving all your trips, access the location, the local weather and have your own adjustable packing list. The weather API used allows the user to see a 5 day forecast in the location selected, the map will give you an interactive map starting at your selected location & your personalised packing list, provides some default items but also the ability to add custom items, ensuring not to forget anything.
